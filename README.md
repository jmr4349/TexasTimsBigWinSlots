### Thank you

Thank you for taking the time to look at my application. It was a ton of fun to learn how to create a ASP.NET api backend, and connect to a Reactjs front end application. This is my first time creating something in Reactjs, so I am sure there are some best practices I missed. I am very eager to learn more about it though. I would love to hear feedback on how I can improve on this. I also added some small features that I thought would be logical for a slot machine game.

### How to Run

This application is using concurrently version 9.1.0 to run the front and and the backend off of one terminal input. In the terminal, cd to wherever you installed the TexasTimsBigWinSlots folder. Then just run "npm run dev" and it should boot right up. You can find the configuration of this in TexasTimsBigWinSlots\package.json file in the main folder. It was incredibly useful throughout the testing process.
